                Timbersleds offer an easier learning curve and can handle any terrain or conditions with less energy due to design and weight savings. They allow you to go places you have only dreamed of going. Whether its tight trees, steep side-hills, or jumping off cliffs, timbersleds let you conquer the most extreme and difficult terrain. Imagine turning your local playground into a supercross freestyle terrain park with the softest landings.

            <p>You haven't ridden anything like the Yamaha YZ450F before. The frame is stronger, the bodywork is slimmer, and the motor is smoother and more powerful than anything Yamaha's made before. Add heated handlebars, aftermarket seat, LED headlight, spare fuel, and electric start, and this bike stands alone.</p>

            <p>The best bike deserves the best snow bike kit, so we added the Yeti 129 Snow MX Freeride SS. The Yeti 129 has the narrowest track and rails of any kit on the market. It's a bike that really handles like a bike! Test riders described it as nimble and agile. With its 5.5” rail spacing, corners and 180-degree downhill turns have never been smoother. The Yeti 129 is better than the rest because it's constructed with materials more commonly found in fighter jets, like a carbon chassis that can withstand 75 to 100-foot drops, titantium bolts and shafts that increase horsepower and durability, and a belt drive that's 22% more efficient than a chain drive. Spend a little extra money to rent this bike, and you won't regret it. It's the top-of-the-line bike paired with the top-of-the-line snow bike kit. It doesn't get any better than this.</p>

            <p>Again we start off with the brand new YZ450F. Extremely smooth, powerful and comfortable. The Yamaha YZ450F might just be the best bike to convert to a snow bike. Electric start is a very important feature to have when riding all day in the Rocky Mountain backcountry, and this bike has it. We've found that a true “race bike” or “track bike” transmission works best for snow bikes. We've also found suspension must be tuned specifically for a snow bike setup, and ours are tuned to perfection. They all have extra fuel, lights and storage bags, so you can survive a full day riding the Rockies.</p>

            <p>We add a Timbersled 120 Short Track to the YZ450F. This short track is the most popular track for all-mountain conditions. It's great on trails, jumping, boondocking and even deep-and-steep. The short track holds higher RPMs, so you can traverse amazing terrain.</p>

            <p>We start with a Yamaha WR450F and then turn it into a Yamaha WR480 Big Bore. Extra power to turn the 120 Timbersled Long Track in deep powder. This bike is also equipped with electric start, lights, extra fuel, storage bag and tuned suspension. This is the machine you want on those epic powder days, steep hill climbs, adventureous boondocking, or if you're a large guy. Longer tracks float much better in snow than shorter tracks. </p>

            <p>We start with the KTM 300 XC, which has enough power to conquer all sorts of terrain. It has an extremely lightweight chassis and a powerful 2-stroke engine, giving it a superb power-to-weight ratio. We've heavily modified this bike to give it the best possible performance. Here's a list of upgrades: custom suspension, aftermarket pipe, silencer, levers, hand guards, radiator guards, handlebars, steering damper, Slavens Mule kit, and a Rekluse clutch. These upgrades make the KTM 300 XC lighter, stronger and even faster! Did we mention it has electric start? That's right. To make the bike even easier to ride, it comes with electric and kickstart. We then add Timbersleds SX 120 purpose-built race machine.  The narrow track, chassis and tunnel combined with race-inspired suspension gives this bike the ultimate motocross feel and handling in all snow conditions. This setup is perfect for the advanced rider who wants neither the weight of a 4-stroke nor the power loss. This bike eats tight trees for breakfast and spits out huge airs for lunch!</p>@*<a href="reservations" class="btn-u btn-brd-hover rounded btn-u-lg"><i class="fa fa-calendar"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Make a Reservation</a>*@

            <p>​The 2018 Yamaha YZ450F is an all-new design! Nothing on the bike on the bike! The result is a radically different frame, a smooth motor that delivers more power than ever before, slimmer bodywork, and sophisticated electronic technology. Add electric start and this could be one of the greatest dirtbikes to hit the market in years.  This bike is  designed for the track and to win races. However, with these improvements, this bike is much more easy to ride on the trail then most race bikes out there.

            <p>​​Great for cruising around town, the Honda Ruckus has a 50cc engine, so you don't need a motorcycle license to ride it on the road. The large tires allow you to ride off-road. With an automatic transmission, the Ruckus is a great bike to teach people how to ride.</p>@*<a href="reservations" class="btn-u btn-brd-hover rounded btn-u-lg"><i class="fa fa-calendar"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Make a Reservation</a>*@
